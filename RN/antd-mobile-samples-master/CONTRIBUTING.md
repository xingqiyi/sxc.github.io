## Contributing fixes to existing samples

A bug must have an issue tracking it in the issue tracker that has been approved.
Your pull request should include a link to the bug that you are fixing.
If you've submitted a PR for a bug, please post a comment in the bug to avoid duplication of effort.

## Contributing new samples

New samples may be accepted, but will need to first be approved in the suggestion issue.

For new samples, please provide a detailed explanation of the intended sample, list of technologies or tools used, and an explanation of why existing samples are not sufficient and a new sample is needed.

A sample should be well documented.
Please include comments in code as well as content in the a `README.md` explaining why steps are being taken.
Comments should also be included in build files if applicable.
A good sample `README.md` should read like a walkthrough, guiding the reader through different steps of setting up and building the sample.

A sample should be self-contained.
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the recommended way of acquiring dependencies.

A sample should be IDE/editor-friendly.
